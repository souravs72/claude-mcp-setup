## 🎯 After Pushing

1. **Set GitHub Secrets**

   ```bash
   cd /home/clapgrow/Desktop/claude-mcp-setup/cloud
   ./setup-github-secrets.sh
   ```

2. **Trigger Deployment**

   ```bash
   # Merge dev to main for automatic deployment
   git checkout main
   git merge dev
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Watch Deployment**
   - Go to: https://github.com/souravs72/claude-mcp-setup/actions
   - Watch your infrastructure deploy automatically!

## 🔍 Verify No Secrets

Before pushing, you can verify:

```bash
./PUSH_SAFELY.sh
```

This checks that no actual secrets are in the code (only format validators and examples).
